# Address Book
#### C Sharp and ASP.Net web app for creating and displaying contact information, 2-09-18  

#### _By Stephanie Faber_  

## Description
_This is a project designed to take user input in the form of contact information and display it. The Index page on localhost:5000/contacts shows a list of all contacts as well as a link to add more contacts. If there are contacts listed you can click on them to see the specific details of that contact, such as their name, phone number, and address. At the bottom of the details page there are 2 links, one to make another contact, and one to go back to the homepage. The page for creating a contact has a form to take in user input for name, phone number, and address.
